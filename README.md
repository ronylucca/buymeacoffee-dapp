# Next.js - Tailwind CSS Example using Hardhat for Solidity Smart Contracts and Waffle

This is a simple NextJS project integrated with Solidity smart contract. 

It is a NextJS - TailwindCss built in with Hardhat and Waffle for smart contract tests. 


# It's a Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
- Install all project dependencies. 
- Update hardhat config and use it to deploy the contrat using deploy.js
- Update ABI and contract address references to NextJS project. 
- Run NextJS project.
